This package a struture for implementing gimpys<br>
A gimpy is PixCaptcha with the question "Spell the word".
Gimpy is based on the human ability to read extremely distorted and corrupted text,
and the inability of current computer programs to do the same.

This package defines a new CaptchaFactory and two new interfaces :
<ul>
<li>GimpyFactory : a CaptchaFactory building Gimpies from words</li>
<li>WordGenerator : provides words to GimpyFactory</li>
<li>WordToImage : build a image (BufferedImage) from a word (String)</li>
</ul>
