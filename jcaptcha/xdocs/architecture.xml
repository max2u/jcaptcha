            <p>
                The JCaptcha project has been design to enable extension and configuration.
                <ul>
                <li>Extension concerns definition and implementation of new tests. This is achieved throught the core module and the Captcha interface that defines a Captcha test with a high level of abstraction</li>
                <li>Extension also concerns integration of the JCaptcha framework in applications. This is achieved throught the integration modules which allows developpers to easily add a new module that will provide integration of the CaptchaService implementation and the choosen technology</li>
                <li>Configuration concerns the Captcha tests. This is achieved throught engine module and the componized CaptchaFactories</li>
                <li>Configuration also concerns the CatchaService and modules. This is achieved throught sevice and its managed implementation that uses the MBean technology, modules provides their own configuration facilities</li>
                </ul>
